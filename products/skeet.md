Following on from the success of Canterbury's DTL/Trap wireless unit, this Skeet version is now fully developed. This system has taken a lot of work to enable it to seamlessly integrate into any Club's Skeet field as we found that there are so many different ways that Skeet fields are wired up, powered up, connected to target management units, etc, that we went down several dead ends in the process of this development. However, what we have ended up with will fit any Club's facility and give perfect target release over voice activation as well as the High to Low targets being 'armed' on gun report ready for the next call.

This unit features 2 trap transceivers (although the second 'slave' unit does not actually need to be connected to the second trap machine to work) 1 microphone transceiver and one hand-held remote. This remote can be placed on the microphone stand for solo shooting or where an independent referee is not provided.

Microphone and base are the same components as in all our other units.

The 'master' and 'slave' trap transceivers are powered from a specific Canterbury skeet relay unit and this links it to the trap machines. These transceivers are best located outside the trap house using the special polycarbonate cover provided.

The remote unit engages the required trap transceiver and has 4 operator buttons: **H** for High house (and this also 'pre-engages' the Low house after the shot of the gun) **L** for just the Low house, **D** for Doubles and **M** for Manual operation - where you want to release a target without voice call over the microphone.

The advantages of this wireless system are:

* all targets released on true voice call, i.e. no 'slow' or 'fast' pulls
* reduced club costs where shooters can shot solo or in squads without a puller
* lower grade events do not require a first grade puller any longer
* easy portability of the microphone from station to station
* no cables across the field

Batteries are 4 x AA units in the microphone and 1x 9 volt battery in the remote unit and it is anticipated that a club should get around 100 hours use out of a set. The trap unit is powered by 12V from the relay box connected to a 230V/110V outlet.

An in-built target counter within the remote is to be developed in 2009 and will be backwards compatible to all skeet units.
