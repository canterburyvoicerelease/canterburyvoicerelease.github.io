Canterbury have developed a comprehensive range of products for almost all disciplines of competitive clay target shooting.

Each product either incorporates or is tied into Canterbury's unique voice activation system for the target release. This system removes the need to have a manual target puller and the problem of 'fast' and 'slow' targets is therefore eliminated.

The benefits of this voice activation includes:

* less man-power to run a competition
* reduced expenditure
* equipment will work 24 hours a day 7 days a week and still give the same precise target release
* higher shooting percentages through consistent target presentation

These products are now in use in every major trap shooting country since being introduced in 1999.
