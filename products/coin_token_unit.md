![Coin Token][1] This controller allows a club to connect their trap machine and/or voice release system for complete target management control. Target 'slippage' is a constant problem at clubs and this provides a simple solution.
                        
The unit is programmable to allow:

- a set number of targets to be released
- different coins to pay for different number of targets
- different tokens to pay for different number of targets
- a combination of coins and tokens to pay for different numbers of targets

The unit is made from stainless steel so is both weather and tamper proof. 

> We have the token box connected to a Canterbury Trapmaster machine (with 600 target capacity) - this combination certainly reduces the burden on the club's volunteer range officers.
> I have found the people at Canterbury very helpful in answering my questions concerning the use of this machine - it has been a pleasure dealing with Canterbury.
