Graham Callander had a distinguished career in analogue and power electronic research and development in New Zealand. As a non-shooter, Graham's emotional detachment from the sport meant a very critical and constructive approach was assured to this complex piece of equipment. Following Graham's death in 2010 the company continued under Bruce Rickard's management. In 2017 the enterprise of Canterbury Voice Release Partnership was set up between CVRI Ltd and Sicom Ltd to continue manufacture, distribution and product development.

Extensive testing is carried out in all types of weather conditions - heat, wind, rain, snow, etc. The system has to almost completely eliminate releasing on background sounds - traffic, airplanes, dogs barking, etc and range noises - gun breaking, shotgun blasts, referee calls, etc. Then the system has to mimic the human puller and a delay of 1/6th sec was incorporated, so that competitors see the same release as they are currently used to.

As can be imagined, designing equipment to these parameters was not easy - but it's been done. CVR was the first to successfully develop a system that performs to the shooters' requirements, that's why our brand name is what you see at all major shoots.
