This equipment was originally developed by Graham Callander as a direct result of competitors' requests for a system that actually worked. After nearly 18 months of painstaking research and development at the Canterbury Clay Target Club in Christchurch, New Zealand, the end result is a product that has exceeded all expectations.

This is truly _"equipment that competitors demand"_.

Since its introduction to the sport of DTL shooting in early 1999, the base product platform has been expanded to cater for American Trap, Nordic Trap and Skeet (English, American and Olympic). We still support ZZ/Helice, Olympic Bunker/Double Trap & 5-Trap, and 5-Stand shooting but no longer supply new equipment. CVR are recognised as the world's leading supplier of voice activation systems and this equipment is used in almost every major international competitive event, along with the majority of domestic and national shoots.

Canterbury Voice Release is dedicated to developing and selling clay target release systems. A wireless version of the standard DTL/American Trap unit has since been developed at the request of shooters to cater for handicap events where cables across the field were both annoying and potentially hazardous.
