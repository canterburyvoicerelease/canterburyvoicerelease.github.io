Graham Callander began development work on the Canterbury system back in 1992 and with his scientific approach as to how the end product should work, he took a no-compromise stance on performance.

That is why you now see a product that has no dials, knobs or settings that require the equipment to be "tuned" in to its surroundings. Other than an 'on/off' button (and for Skeet - the shooting sequencer) the DTL/American Trap unit is simply - switch it on and use it! Nothing could be simpler.

Once used by competitors, they will not go back to a manual puller. As one Australian commentator said _"this is one of the biggest steps forward in the history of clay target shooting. It rivals screw chokes and comb stocks in terms of technical advancement"_.

The same philosophy has been applied to the more complex units that operate Olympic Bunker, ZZ/Helice and 5-Stand where target sequences have to be loaded. The control panels are all straight-forward and simple to operate.
